            Purpose: This policy outlines the procedures for the secure and
            timely deletion of data to ensure compliance with privacy
            regulations and mitigate risks associated with data retention.
            Scope: This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and
            third-party vendors who handle sensitive or personal data within the
            organization.

            Policy:
          </h2>
          <p className='mt-6'>
            Data Identification: Regularly identify and classify data based on
            its sensitivity and relevance to business operations. Retention
            Periods: Establish clear retention periods for different types of
            data in accordance with legal requirements and business needs. Data
            Deletion Procedures: Upon reaching the end of its retention period
            or upon request for deletion, data must be securely erased from all
            systems and storage devices. Data deletion procedures must include
            physical and digital media, such as hard drives, databases, servers,
            and cloud storage. Secure Deletion Methods: Use industry-standard
            methods for data deletion, such as encryption, overwriting, or
            physical destruction, to prevent unauthorized recovery. Ensure that
            deleted data cannot be reconstructed or retrieved by unauthorized
            parties. Documentation and Tracking: Maintain records of data
            deletion activities, including the date, reason, and method of
            deletion. Document any exceptions or deviations from the standard
            deletion procedures. Employee Training: Provide regular training to
            employees on the importance of data deletion and the proper
            procedures to follow. Ensure employees understand their
            responsibilities regarding data deletion and the potential
            consequences of non-compliance. Third-Party Compliance: Require
            third-party vendors and service providers to adhere to the
            organization's data deletion policies and procedures. Include
            contractual obligations regarding data deletion and secure disposal
            in vendor agreements. Monitoring and Auditing: Regularly monitor
            data deletion activities to ensure compliance with policies and
            regulations. Conduct periodic audits to verify the effectiveness of
            data deletion procedures and identify areas for improvement.
